# Constraint-Based-Pathfinding
Implemented a solution for solving a maze using Breadth-First Search (BFS), accommodating various restrictions and incorporating teleportation mechanics under specific conditions. This project highlights strong algorithmic design skills and the ability to adapt classical search techniques to complex, constraint-driven scenarios
